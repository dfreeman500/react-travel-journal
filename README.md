# React Travel Journal


This is a Solo Project idea/challenge from Scrimba.com. The challenge is to create a webpage that uses react props to display the components of a travel journal. The focus was to utilize data from a source and present the structure in a methodical way. The design can be found on Figma.com. This project was created locally using Create React App for bootstrapping (Scrimba encourages using their online environment).
